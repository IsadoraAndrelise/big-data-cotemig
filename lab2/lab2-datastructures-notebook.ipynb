    """Swap the keys and values in a dictionary, where duplicated values map to a list of keys
    The easiest way to solve this problem is by looping over the keys and values
    of the dictionary using `.items()`. If the value hasn't been seen before, we need
    to set some reasonable default value in our dictionary - in this case, a list to
    store the associated keys. Then, we can append (in-place!) our key to the list
    of keys associated to this value.
    It's possible to write this update step in one line using the default of `.get()`
        out[value] = out.get(value, []).append(key)
    However, I don't think that looks nearly as readable.
    Note: there is a tool in the `collections` module from the standard library
    called `defaultdict` which exports this functionality. You provide it a factory
    method for creating default values in the dictionary (in this case, a list.)

    """Practice reading comprehensions and explore oddities with function calls
    Each list comprehension is replicated below with an explanation:
    [x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4]]
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
        Constructs a list containing exactly the elements in [1, 2, 3, 4].
        Not a very interesting list comprehension at all, since the `x for x`
        means that no transformation will happen over the range.
    [n - 2 for n in range(10)]
    # => [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
        Subtracts 2 from each of the elements in range(10). For example, the
        first element of range(10) is n = 0, so the first element of our generated
        list is n - 2 = -2. The pattern then continues for the rest of the elements.
    [k % 10 for k in range(41) if k % 3 == 0]
    # => [0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9]
        Gets the last digit of any number under 41 that is a multiple of 3.
        Note that the `if k % 3 == 0` is a filtering condition! We'll see more
        about filtering Week 4.
    [s.lower() for s in ['PythOn', 'iS', 'cOoL'] if s[0] < s[-1]]
    # => ['python']
        Builds the lowercased words if the first character is smaller than
        the last character.
        For example, when s = 'Python', we have s[0] = 'P' and s[-1] = 'n',
        and since 'P' < 'n' (compared by ASCII values), we pass our filter
        condition, and so contribute 'python' to the final list.
        On the other hand, both 'iS' and 'cOoL' do not satisfy s[0] < s[-1],
        so they are not passed to s.lower() for inclusion in the final list.
    arr = [[3,2,1], ['a','b','c'], [('do',), ['re'], 'mi']]
    print([el.append(el[0] * 4) for el in arr])
    # => [None, None, None]
    print(arr)
    # => [
      [3, 2, 1, 12],
      ['a', 'b', 'c', 'aaaa'],
      [('do',), ['re'], 'mi', ('do', 'do', 'do', 'do')]
    ]
        What's going on here? .append() is a function that returns None,
        so the list comprehension returns a list of three Nones, but the
        effect of the append still takes place - that is, the array elements
        themselves are still updated. Since 3 is an integer, 3 * 4 = 12 is
        appended to the end of the first list. Since 'a' is a string,
        'a' * 4 = 'aaaa' is appended to the end of the second list. Since
        ('do',) is a tuple, ('do',) * 4 = ('do', 'do', 'do', 'do') is appended
        to the end of the third list. Note that this is an example of duck-typing
        in action!
    [letter for letter in "pYthON" if letter.isupper()]
    # => ['Y', 'O', 'N']
        Simple enough. Keeps only the upper case letters in "pYthON", which are
        'Y', 'O', and 'N'. Interesting, the result is a list of characters, not
        a string, as you might guess. This is because the list comprehension
        traverses the string "pYthON" as a sequence of 1-character strings.
    {len(w) for w in ["its", "the", "remix", "to", "ignition"]}
    # => {2, 3, 5, 8}
        Our first set comprehension, this gives all the unique lengths of words
        in the argument list, which in this case are [3, 3, 5, 2, 8] respectively.
        Since sets don't keep duplicate elements, we're left with {2, 3, 5, 8}.
